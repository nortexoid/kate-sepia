# kate-sepia
A sepia color schema for KDE's Kate text editor based slightly on Solarized light, meeting WCAG AA contrast requirements.

The text color does not change on highlight/selection, which gives it a more realistic paper feel. Despite this, the contrast for text on highlight still meets WCAG's minimum contrast ratio.

Many of the colors used have human readable html color names.
